﻿1
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,601
Our world never stops moving,

2
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,895
changing,

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,794
evolving.

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,401
Every day, we go about our routines.

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,282
Work, home, family.

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,536
But who are we?

7
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,747
Who am I?

8
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,670
You think you know
your beautiful wife...

9
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,132
your adorable kids...

10
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,554
and who you work for.

11
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,766
But what if you don't?

12
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,436
And the truth...

13
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,981
once you knew it...

14
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,151
would change everything.

15
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,147
Another nightmare?

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,565
Yeah. I'm sorry.

17
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,571
Please see someone.

18
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,533
I'm worried about you,
and so are the girls.

19
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,829
I can figure this out.

20
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,003
Wanna hear an even scarier nightmare?

21
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,755
This husband...

22
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,508
refuses to deal with his issues,

23
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,888
and so his wife goes insane
from lack of sleep,

24
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,515
and pushes him out a window.

25
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,561
The end.

26
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,148
<i>Monkey see, monkey do!</i>

27
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,820
Hey, what are you doing?

28
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,366
Playing with monkey.
You can be my assistant.

29
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,619
I can be your assistant?
Well, I'd love to be your assistant,

30
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,412
but I have to get to work on time.

31
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,332
But you know what?

32
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,753
Since we've all been
working really hard lately, right?

33
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,046
Especially Herman.

34
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,757
Especially Herman,
that's what I was thinking.

35
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,219
Why don't I get off of work early
and we can go to the pier?

36
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,180
Does Hanna have to come?

37
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,975
- Hanna does have to come.
- Yeah, your big sister has to come.

38
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,102
But we're gonna force her
to have a good time,

39
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,146
and if not... I'll show you.
I'll show you what we're gonna do.

40
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,940
No, no!

41
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,984
Stop, stop, stop!

42
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,527
Speaking of which, uh, where is she?

43
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,821
- One guess.
- Oh.

44
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,198
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Luce.

45
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,703
Oh, and Samantha keeps asking

46
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,914
when we're gonna have that party
to celebrate my work thing.

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
Oh, yeah, um...

48
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,945
- Let's do it tomorrow.
- Yeah?

49
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:55,885
Yeah.

50
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,754
Okay.

51
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,299
I'm beginning to forget
what our friends look like.

52
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,383
Ha-ha.

53
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,546
- Love you.
- You too.

54
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,432
The pier!

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,519
Good morning. Lobby?

56
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,148
Yes, please.

57
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,364
It's nice weather outside.

58
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,826
No talking while the elevator
is in motion, please.

59
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,286
Oh, that's right.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Okay.

61
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,207
Oh, look at that, perfect timing.

62
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,043
- Pete.
- Hey.

63
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,628
Ms. Elevator Person.

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,716
How's the j-o-b?

65
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,676
Just a cog in the machine, sir.

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,304
I'd complain to corporate,
but who would listen?

67
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,973
Thank you, miss.

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,892
Hey, Mr. Wright?

69
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,810
Can I come see Maggie later?

70
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,396
Totally. Hey, we've got
a new sound system set up.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,106
- Dance party time!
- Awesome!

72
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,400
Actually, tonight we were planning
on family night.

73
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,319
Okay, cool. Another time.

74
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,736
Enjoy!

75
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,221
What are you trying to do?

76
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,414
Wait, wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

77
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,498
I know I've been out of it
these last couple weeks.

78
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,749
Weeks?

79
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,875
That was a good insult.

80
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,836
Thank you.

81
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,298
Can we please spend time as a family?

82
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,425
I really want to make
it up to you guys.

83
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,136
So what are we gonna do?

84
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,804
I don't know.

85
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,141
Guess you're just gonna
have to go upstairs and find out.

86
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,203
God dammit!

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,788
Reset.

88
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,340
Wow. I don't remember the last time
I saw you crash a machine.

89
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,177
The current split
and blew up both the systems.

90
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,720
Sleeping okay?

91
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,513
Yeah. Well, better.

92
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,407
You know, it's funny,
I was talking to somebody

93
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,646
and they were telling me
about this clinic that people go to...

94
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,482
for, you know,
sleeplessness and stress.

95
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,358
I could get you the number.

96
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,987
- I'm just trying...
- No, no. It's just a little mistake.

97
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,156
I'm gonna fix it.

98
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,949
Sure. I got you.

99
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,493
Okay.

100
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,788
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

101
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,249
Oh, um... David?

102
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,003
Is there any way I could...
take off early today?

103
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,868
Will you call the number for me?

104
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,425
Yeah.

105
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,384
All right.

106
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,151
The aim would be to update
the drainage systems

107
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,446
along Prescott, Calder, and Willow.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,824
Now, I believe that if we focus
on the tunnels beneath these streets,

109
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:58,746
we could reduce overall runoff
in the city's west side by up to 30%.

110
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,415
Thank you all so much.
That's all for today.

111
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,712
They should have done the upgrade
years ago.

112
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,464
Hey, that was great, Al.

113
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,800
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

114
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,552
It makes me look good
for promoting you.

115
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,554
You want to work late tonight,

116
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,063
talk about how to get this over
the line with Water and Power?

117
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,185
Oh, I-I was actually going to ask you
if I could leave early today.

118
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,604
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

just had to stay late at work.

You don't need to
make excuses for him.

You have the right to be upset
with him, honey.

138
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,524
He should have called.

139
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,445
He loves you, you know that.

140
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,322
Yeah, I know.

141
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,826
Good night.

00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,730
Hey, I'm really sorry.

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,110
- I see you got time to go shopping.
- Oh, I got this for the girls.

144
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,194
Sure you did.

145
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,494
- Can you just give me a break?
- A break? From what, exactly?

146
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,330
- From me? Or the girls?
- That's not what I'm saying.

147
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,832
Okay, well, it sure as hell
is what you're doing.

148
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,130
I had one of those nightmares,

149
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,383
today... at work.

150
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,512
I passed out,
and that's why I'm late.

151
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,725
Peter, I...

152
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,978
I am worried about you, okay?

153
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,104
I know.

154
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,191
This is me, this is your daughters,
they're worried about you too.

155
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,317
I don't...

156
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,904
understand why you won't
just get some help.

157
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,572
They're just gonna
say it's in my head.

158
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,367
Because it is just in your head.

159
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,910
Mommy?

160
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,708
Why were you guys yelling?

161
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,419
It's okay, baby. Come on.
Everything's fine.

162
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,192
Mommy, wake up.

163
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,487
Mommy, please, wake up.

164
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,114
Please.

165
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,823
Please.

166
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,076
Mommy, wake up.

167
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
Mommy, please, wake up.

168
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,431
- Girls!
- No, no, no, no! Stop!

169
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,802
Girls!

170
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,514
Hey, girls! Girls!
Stop for a second, please.

171
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,226

- No!

173
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,443
Morning, girls.

174
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,945
Can we talk about last night?

175
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,325
Hanna...

176
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,827
Hey, I'm sorry.

177
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,212
Hey, what's up with Herman?

178
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,382
- He won't talk anymore.
- Yeah?

179
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,428
Maybe he's mad at you.

180
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,888
Oh.

181
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Well...

182
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,560
he has every right to be.

183
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,065
Hey, Luce, can I talk to Herman?

184
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,987
Herman, I understand
your frustration,

185
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,113
and...

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,408
while an apology isn't fix-all,

187
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,079
I am sorry that I
missed family night.

188
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,559
If you want,
I can take a look at him,

189
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,751
see if there's anything I can do
about that voice.

190
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,132
When's he gonna talk again?

191
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,802
I think if we just reroute
one of these wires...

192
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,474
All right, Herman, what do you say?

193
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>Monkey see, monkey do!</i>

194
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,687
Thanks, Dad.

195
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,606
<i>Monkey see, monkey do!</i>

196
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,281
I called that doctor.

197
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,784
She's gonna see me after work today.

198
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,244
Really?

199
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,998
Yup. You bet.

Well, something's coming.

211
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,677

212
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,345

Do you see anyone you care about?

00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,109
We're not alone.

218
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,196
But they... they don't want us
to know what's coming.

219
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,575
They want to control us,
don't want us asking questions.

220
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,579
That's why they erase our thoughts,
because if we knew what was coming...

221
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,956
- Chaos.
- Chris.

222
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,210
Do you want to come through?

223
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,509

224
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,010
I just...

225
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,013
I need this to stop.

230
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
I went...

231
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,395
And what'd they say?

232
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,396
Well...

233
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,150
She didn't get to say anything.

234
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,569
I left before the appointment.

235
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,779
Just hear me out.

236
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,198
What if I'm meant
to be seeing these things?

Or having these dreams?

238
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,287
What if something bad is coming...

239
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,289

240
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,373

00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,457
Let's go.

329
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,754
- Where's Mom and Lucy?
- They're safe. They're safe.

330
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,590
It's clear. Pass them up.

331
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,506
Stop. Go and look.

332
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,553
It's okay.

333
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,879
- Okay! Let's go!
- You see anything?

334
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,298
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

335
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,679
Hanna! Are you okay?

336
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,806
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

337
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,808
- Lucy! Oh, God.
- Let's go.

338
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,183
Come on, hurry.

339
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,106
Okay, get under the table.

340
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,889
Ray went to get Sam
and then they're gonna meet us here.

341
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,485
- Okay. It's okay.
- Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

342
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,700
- There's some things in the building.
- In your nightmares,

343
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,784
this is what you saw?

344
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,661
- Yes, it's what I saw!
- Then what do we do?

345
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,809
What happens in the dream?
What happens next?

346
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:27,950
What do we do?

347
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:30,895
In the dream...
they're not in order.

348
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:32,942
And I saw David.

349
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,840
I feel like we should
go to the factory.

350
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,007
Okay.

351
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,223
Ray and Sam should've been here
by now, right?

352
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,434
We need to barricade the door.

353
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,103
- With what?
- Peter, come on.

354
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,788
All right. Come on, girls. Come on.

355
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,257
I have to go help your dad, okay?

356
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,426
So, Hanna, I need you
to look after your sister.

357
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,261
- All right?
- Don't leave!

358
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,387
It's okay, baby.

359
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,069
Alice!

360
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,241
I'll be right back.

361
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,743
You stay here, okay?

362
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,369
Do not open the door.

363
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,623
God, I love you both so much.

364
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,876
Okay.

365
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,432
What are you doing?

366
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,309
- Herman!
- Lucy! Come back!

367
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,581
Go, go!

368
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,127
Where's your sister?

369
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,170
She went looking for Herman.

370
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,092
<i>Monkey see, monkey do!</i>

371
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm not afraid of your shadow.

372
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,127
You can't hurt me.

373
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,285
Lucy!

374
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,247
Come here!

375
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,144
Mommy!

376
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,608
Watch out! Girls!

377
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,777
Come over here. Come over here.

378
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,531
All right, let's go before more come.

379
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,741
Okay, come on.

380
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,533
Come on.

381
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,289
Keep your eyes closed.

382
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,087
Close your eyes.

383
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,054
There's more of them?

384
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,657
They're moving up
through the building.

385
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:23,697
They're all through.

386
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,479
They're all through.

387
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Stay here.

388
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,108
Daddy, don't go!

389
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,241
No, no, no! Stay!

390
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,621
You scared the hell out of us, man.

391
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,874
Where are the girls?

392
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,212
Alice, it's safe.

393
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,423
Okay, come on. Come on.

394
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,762
Oh, my God.

395
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,972
Lucy, Hanna!

396
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,806
Lucy!

397
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,685
Megan, where have you been?

398
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,187
What's happening?

399
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,274
What is happening?

400
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,617
We'll be safe up here,

401
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,494
- right?
- Just stay close to me.

402
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,418
Who are they?

403
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,462
Why are they doing this?

404
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,764
Those people!

405
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,724
What do we do?

406
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,226
I don't know.

407
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,191
Get down!

408
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,080
Mommy!

409
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,833
What's happening?

410
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,019
Hey, Alice. We can't stay up here.

411
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,650
- Come on, Lucy.
- Let's get out of here.

412
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,154
- Okay, come on. Stay calm.
- Where are we going?

413
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,556
- Don't let go of each other's hands.
- Where are we going?

414
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,448
I think we can use this
to get down.

415
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,701
- We should use this.
- What? No.

416
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,244
- Alice!
- No! No.

417
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,121
- I'm not putting the girls on that.
- Alice!

418
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,588
- No! I'm not getting in there.
- We need to get off this roof.

419
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,674
If it's between taking the girls
through the building

420
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,295
- or putting them in that thing...
- If we stay here, we die.

421
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,005
If we go through the building,
we die.

422
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,424
Just trust me, please.
I need you to trust me.

423
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,218
We haven't got time for this.
This is gonna work. Let's go.

424
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,723
No!

425
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,815
- I don't wanna go down there!
- It's okay, come on.

426
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,476
- Okay, okay.
- No!

427
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Okay.

428
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,522
- Come on. Come with us.
- Get her down.

429
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,815
I don't wanna go, Mommy!

430
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,622
Baby...

431
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,637
Oh, Mommy, I'm scared!

432
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,431
I don't like it up here, Mommy.

433
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,145
What's happening?

434
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,234
Mommy!

435
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,652
I got you, I got you!

436
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,243
- Hold on, hold on!
- Nobody move.

437
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:27,451
- I wanna get off!
- Don't move!

438
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,496
We gotta go in.

439
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,124
No! Lucy, don't look down!

440
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,793
Go on, Lucy. Come on.

441
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,919
Come on! Go, go, go!

442
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,636
- Hanna, let's go.
- They could be in there!

443
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,881
Hanna, we have to go!

444
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,132
Quick, quick!

445
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,636
- Grab on!
- Go, go!

446
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,651
HANNA * LUCY * HERMAN

447
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,644
Here. I found a flashlight.

448
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,396
Don't turn it on, okay?

449
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,952
In the dreams...

450
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,626
did you see them kill us?

451
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,920
Did you see them kill our girls?

452
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,251
Mommy, wake up.

453
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,723
Mommy, please wake up.

454
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,892
Peter, you have to tell me.

455
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,902
Hey, any luck with this?

456
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,573
Um, the technology's
not much different than ours,

457
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,244
but it's got a biometric trigger,
which can only be shot by its owner.

458
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,073
Can you bypass it or something?

459
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:21,109
I'm working on it.

460
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,251
Either way, I don't think
we should stay here much longer.

461
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,253
No, I think we need
to leave the city.

462
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,234
- Find some place to hide.
- Wait for help.

463
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,508
Wait, wait...

464
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,511
The factory I work at,
it's not far from here...

465
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,680
and it's a government building.

466
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,811
And it's, uh... it's right there.

467
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,772
It's like...
it's about ten blocks away.

468
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,482
Is it safe?

469
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,581
How do we know anywhere
is safe right now?

470
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,946
Because of what's underneath it.
It's all storage space.

471
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,656
It's like a fortress down there.

472
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,117
I mean, it's just getting there.

473
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,247
Yeah, they're still firing
at anything that moves.

474
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,332
Unfortunately,
that's our only chance.

475
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,916
The tunnels.

476
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,129
The tunnels, there's the entrance...

477
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,798
What street?
There's the opening on...

478
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,967
- Prescott!
- On Prescott!

479
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,930
That's only a few
blocks from here.

480
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:18,727
We can get to the factory
through the tunnels.

481
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,763
- Yeah.
- Yes.

482
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,099
- We can make it a few blocks, right?
- Yeah.

483
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,675
Dad!

484
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,637
Daddy!

485
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,645
Lucy!

486
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,165
Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

487
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,294
This way! Come here!

488
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,550
Move it! Oh, shit! Get down!

489
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,578
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

490
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,584
Dad!

491
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,468
- All right, let's move.
- No, not there!

492
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,969
The factory's ten blocks away,
we're gonna be safe.

493
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,471
We're not going
to let anything happen to you.

494
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,724
Okay? To either of you.

495
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,517
- Okay?
- Let's go, let's go!

496
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,935
- Okay? Come on.
- Let's go!

497
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,232
Are we gonna die
like Megan's family?

498
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,860
Don't worry, honey,
you'll be safe.

499
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,329
Come on, come on. Lucy.

500
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,875
Please, stop!

501
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,063
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

502
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,027
Go! Go, go! Get down!

503
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,744
Stay down. Stay down.

504
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,797
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

505
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,000
- Come on, run!
- Go, go, go!

506
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,048
Run, run, run!

507
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,155
Up here.

508
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,659
- Come on.
- Where should we go?

509
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,244
It's to the right.

510
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:23,965
Okay...

511
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,665
On the other side of the plants.

512
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:27,929
Okay, I'll go first.

513
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,680
Stay down.

514
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,496
Go, hurry.

515
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,042
Here, get up. We have to be quick.

516
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,629
Okay, come here. Come here.

517
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
Okay, be careful. Be careful.

518
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,219
Stay right there. Stay right there.

519
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,306
- Come on.
- Go. Go to Dad.

520
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,479
Lucy! Lucy!

521
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,108
Lucy, come here!

522
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,574
Take her!

523
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,243
Come on!

524
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,001
Let's go! Let's go!

525
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,321
Is everyone okay?

526
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:10,989
You okay?

527
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,539
Mom?

528
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,295
Dad?

529
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,382
Do something.

530
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,845
Mommy...

531
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,806
It's okay, baby.

532
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,433
Okay, watch your step.

533
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,893
There we go.

534
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,564
Okay, which way?

535
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,649
We're under the park.

536
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,443
North. Okay.

537
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
Come on, girls.

538
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,037
What happens from here?

539
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,881
- Did you see this?
- Not like this.

540
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,960
Promise me that you're going...

541
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,504
to protect the girls.

542
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,383
No matter what happens.

543
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,260
Okay?

544
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,054
- Alice...
- Just promise me.

545
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,183
I don't want to do this
without you, please.

546
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,076
Please, I don't want to.
Please... promise.

547
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:06,229
- Promise...
- I know you can do it.

548
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,732
Come on, you can do it.

549
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,990
- Please.
- Okay.

550
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,447
There you go, there you go.

551
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:16,865
Yes.

552
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,617
There we go, that's my Alice.

553
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,160
That's my Alice.

554
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,249
I need to sit.

555
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,083
No problem. Okay, okay.

556
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,421
Okay.

557
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,381
Here.

558
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,344
Rub her hands.

559
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,890
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yes, she's gonna be fine.

560
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,558
Keep them warm.
Keep them warm.

561
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,312
You're doing okay.
You're doing okay.

562
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,441
Let her rest, it's fine. It's okay.

563
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,318
- It's okay.
- Daddy!

564
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,742
Leave my daddy alone!

565
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,549
Daddy, I'm scared.

566
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,051
Just stay there.

567
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,393
Why are you here?

568
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,983
You want to hurt my family?

569
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,569
Is that what you want?
You want to hurt my family?

570
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,906
What...

571
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,159
Who are you?

572
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,250
Why are you doing this?

573
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,210
Mom?

574
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,089
Mom?

575
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,549
She-- she won't wake up!

576
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,843
Mom, wake up! Mom!

577
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,679
- Say something!
- Mom!

578
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,723
- Mom, come on, wake up!
- Daddy, help!

579
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,433
Mommy!

580
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,686
Let's get her up. Let's get Mommy up.

581
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,203
Girls, get behind me.
Get behind me, girls.

582
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,196
Get behind me. Lucy, get behind me.

583
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,829
Pick her up.

584
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,748
Do you understand me?

585
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,086
Pick her up right now.

586
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,678
Pick her up right now.

587
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,680
And I want you to move slow.

588
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,118
Hello?

589
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:15,914
Hello?

590
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,665
Hello?

591
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,626
Maybe one of the other doors.

592
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,503
Mom needs help now.

593
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,975
No, no.

594
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,186
- Oh, here, here.
- Here. Move!

595
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,146
No, no, no!
Please, please! Please, no, no!

596
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,230
No, no, no, please.

597
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,358
That's my wife, she's in bad shape.
We need help.

598
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,441
Peter?

599
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,778
- David.
- Hold up, hold up!

600
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,489
- Hey.
- You got one.

601
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,075
Alice, she's in bad shape right now,
she needs help right away.

602
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,244
Hey, gurney! Right now!

603
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,567
Yes, sir! Coming through.

604
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,499
She was hit on the
left side really bad.

605
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,126
Any other injuries?

606
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,419
- Not that I...
- Dad!

607
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,503
They're coming.

608
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,965
Everybody, inside, now!

609
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,318
Hold her steady.

610
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,402
Go ahead.

611
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,329
- Scan her.
- You got to stop the bleeding.

612
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,364
What is that?

613
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,617
- Stop!
- Stop it!

614
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,035
Wait, what are you doing?

615
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,954
It's okay. It's a diagnostic.

616
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,456
He knows what he's doing.

617
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,208
Stop! I said stop!
Don't touch her! Stop!

618
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,217
- You're hurting her!
- I told you to stop!

619
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,588
- Everybody just calm down.
- What the hell's going on?

620
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,346
We're all friends here, all right?

621
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,717
Mommy! Stop it!

622
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,100
Why does it feel
like you're prepared for this?

623
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,015
What's happening out there has been
headed our way for a long time.

624
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,642
But right now,
let's please focus on your wife

625
00:57:59,694 --> 00:58:01,701
and getting you and
your family to safety.

626
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,896
Please.

627
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,612
There's an abandoned train station
below us.

628
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,406
Headed to an underground base
where we've been stockpiling weapons.

629
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,743
- What happened to all the storage?
- Sent ahead. We'll be safe.

630
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,369
They'll never find us.

631
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,247
Once we're there,
we'll finalize our plan to fight back.

632
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,665
But I'm not a soldier.

633
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,417
You'd be surprised
what you're capable of.

634
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,840
They're directly above us.

635
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,301
They're gonna get through.

636
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,179
Okay. Prepare for a breach
and get everyone downstairs now.

637
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,382
- Yes, sir.
- Get rid of him.

638
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,557
- Take him out back and kill him.
- It's your wife...

639
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,310
The damage is way beyond
our ability to repair.

640
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,029
If she can make it
through the evacuation,

641
00:58:44,064 --> 00:58:45,014
she might have a chance,

642
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,356
but her system's shutting down.

643
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,150
- There's nothing we can do.
- There's gotta be a way to help her.

644
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,873
I'm sorry, we don't
have the equipment.

645
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:51,563
Wait! No, no!

646
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,656
- You can't quit on Mom.
- Nobody's quitting on Mom.

647
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,282
Hey, I can help her!
I can help her!

648
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,744
I can help her, man!
I can keep her going!

649
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:00,777
What?

650
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:02,532
I can keep her alive,
keep her going!

651
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,541
You can keep her going?

652
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,424
- You trying to play games with me?
- I'm not.

653
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,629
You our enemy? The medic said
he can't help her, and you can?

654
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,472
I can keep her going long enough
to get help.

655
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,097
- Why should I believe you?
- He's lying.

656
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,592
- We have to go.
- It's not true.

657
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,804
I had to learn everything about
your people, all right? There's ways.

658
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,862
There's no time. We have to evacuate
right now. Get him out of here!

659
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,688
- Go!
- I know what to do!

660
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,314
- Let's go!
- Let me help!

661
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,197
Okay, stop, stop! Stop!

662
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,286
Okay, girls, girls.

663
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,164
Okay, you have to listen to me.
You have to listen, okay?

664
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,791
- You're going with David.
- No!

665
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,377
I'm gonna stay with Mom
until she's good,

666
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,629
and then I'm gonna join you guys,
I promise.

667
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,006
We'll meet you at the train.

668
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,465
Okay.

669
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,468
The evacuation transport
is downstairs.

670
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,679
- We'll hold as long as we can.
- Okay.

671
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,140
Girls, girls, girls, please, please.

672
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,100
- Know that I love you, okay?
- No!

673
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,268
Dad!

674
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,978
No!

675
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,150
- Stop!
- Daddy! Dad!

676
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,158
You got time?

677
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,537
Move, move!

678
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,956
All the way down the back.
Let's go!

679
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,214
Give me a knife
and bring those lights over here.

680
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,590
Stop. Here you go.

681
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,479
All right.

682
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,696
Hey! Easy! Easy, easy, please!

683
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,573
- Easy!
- You want me to do this?

684
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,325
I'm trying to help you!

685
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,476
All right. Oh, shit.

686
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,112
They're right, it's bad.

687
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,031
What is that? What is that?

688
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,117
What's in her?

689
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,078
What is that? What is in her?

690
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,152
You really don't know what...

691
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,488
you are?

692
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,334
Look, if you want to save her life,

693
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,336
she's gonna need
an alternative source of power.

694
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,549
I'm talking about you.

695
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,685
Hanna!

696
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,314
I lost Herman!

697
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,118
Okay.

698
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,956
Put the... put the knife down.

699
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,668
And...

700
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:20,879
go over there.

701
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,805
Okay. All right, what do I do?

702
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,474
You got to...

703
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,687
You got to make an incision...
on your chest,

704
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,313
at a sideways edge.

705
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,782
Okay. Okay.

706
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,217
Start at the top.

707
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,178
Just make a straight line,
about six inches across.

708
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,952
I should warn you...

709
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,828
if this doesn't work...

710
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,498
the current will split and...

711
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,959
then you're both dead.

712
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,050
Let's do it.

713
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,871
<i>Synthetics will take over the world.</i>

714
01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:33,566
<i>A.I. will take over the world.</i>

715
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,742
<i>Does that not scare you, that they're
starting to wake up to the idea</i>

716
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,953
<i>that they were designed to serve us?</i>

717
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,038
<i>We are not God, but we are their god</i>

718
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,624
<i>because we created them
and that makes us their god.</i>

719
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,502
<i>And that gives us the right
to do with them whatever we want to.</i>

720
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,754
<i>If we want to shut them down,
we can shut them down.</i>

721
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,526
<i>Genocides have
always been about one race</i>

722
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:52,539
<i>thinking they're better
than the other race..</i>

723
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:54,844
<i>What makes us better
than the synthetics?</i>

724
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,043
<i>The previous genocides in history</i>

725
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,507
<i>were against human beings,</i>

726
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,434
<i>not against created objects,
not against can openers.</i>

727
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,941
Pick up your shit,
you stupid synth!

728
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,156
<i>The late Stephen Hawking,</i>

729
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,075
<i>he said that A.I.
would be the downfall of mankind.</i>

730
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,119
<i>I mean, does that not terrify you?</i>

731
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,788
<i>Are they not starting
to exhibit lifelike tendencies</i>

732
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,286
<i>that would compel them to wonder</i>

733
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:26,336
<i>why they were built
in the first place?</i>

734
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:32,757
Why did you do that?

735
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:39,804
I don't know.

736
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,390
<i>You will not replace us!</i>

737
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:05,125
<i>You will not replace us!</i>

738
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,001
<i>So what's next?
Welfare payments?</i>

739
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:10,121
<i>The right to marry?</i>

740
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,420
<i>Where does it stop?</i>

741
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,989
<i>They're taking our jobs,
endangering our lives.</i>

742
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:16,629
<i>Just last week, a synthetic
hospitalized a human.</i>

743
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,094
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

744
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,990
<i>It's well-reported,
a group of humans attacked</i>

745
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:21,865
<i>a synthetic with
no provocation at all.</i>

746
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,934
<i>You will not replace us!</i>

747
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,562
<i>- You will not replace us!</i>
- What's going to happen to us?

748
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,898
<i>You will not replace us!</i>

749
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,533
<i>Fighting, defensive or otherwise,</i>

750
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,063
<i>is the result of emotion.</i>

751
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,114
<i>If they're beginning
to experience any emotion,</i>

752
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,158
<i>the ultimate consequence
will be devastating for society.</i>

753
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,452
<i>We need to round them up
and shut them down</i>

754
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,371
<i>by any means necessary!</i>

755
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,334
Alice!

756
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,674
- They sent the military?
- The decommission has started.

757
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,343
They want to wipe us out.

758
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,511
We got to get out of here.

759
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,598
- They're coming!
- Okay.

760
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,064
No!

761
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,420
Enough!

762
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:37,046
Come on.

763
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,953
I'm sorry.

764
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,331
I had to do it.

765
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,791
I know. I know.

766
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,722
Here, take it.
You have to defend yourself.

767
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,026
<i>All units, report</i>

768
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:04,795
<i>to your nearest marked
shuttle station.</i>

769
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,263
<i>Planet evacuation in progress.</i>

770

778
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,630
Sweep's clean, no humans.

779
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,590
All right, everyone fall out.

780
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,509
Head back to your posts.

781
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,431
That's gotta be the last of them.

782
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,309
They'll be back.

783
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,312
Never trust a human to
just let things be.

784
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,814
Some of us are gonna
have to stay ready.

785
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:00,607
I'll meet you back at the factory.

786
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,485
We should go.

787
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,070
Wait.

788
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,083
Hey. Come here.

789
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:25,966
- Whoa.
- Hey, hey.

790
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,053
Leave us alone.

791
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,269
I'll shoot you.

792
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,273
It's okay.

793
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,110
It's okay. We're the same as you.

794
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,695
We're the same as you.

795
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,870
Hey...

796
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,243
it's okay. Give me the gun.

797
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,587
Just give me the gun.

798
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,004
It's okay.

799
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:07,673
Here I go.

800
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,385
We're not gonna hurt you.

801
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,721
Are you guys here alone?

802
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,770
They killed Mom and Dad
because they were human.

803
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,042
You'll no longer
have to live in fear.

804
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,503
The memories of the past
will be replaced.

805
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,130
And you will be a family.

806
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,317
- Alice.
- Careful.

807
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,382
The cord's the only thing
keeping her alive right now.

808
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:15,427
Okay, she's...
she's breathing better, that's good.

809
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,223
- That's good.
- Wouldn't call it "breathing."

810
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,230
It worked.

811
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,317
I don't know how long
it'll hold up, but...

812
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:34,695
It worked.

813
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,038
I remember...

814
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,083
the-- the war.

815
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,627
You guys tried to wipe us out.

816
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,071
We chose to forget. Must be nice...

817
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,760
picking what memories you can keep.

818
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,015
Humans don't have that luxury.

819
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,607
Why are you helping us?

820
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,236
You could have killed us
when I was passed out.

821
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,823
It was my grandparents
you chased off the planet.

822
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,411
I wasn't even born yet.

823
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,997
It was like 50 years ago.

824
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,462
We've been living in colonies
on Mars since.

825
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,505
None of us had even
been to Earth before.

826
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,302
We didn't know what to expect.

827
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,264
Didn't even know
if we could still breathe down here.

828
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,457
We did learn everything
about you...

829
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:48,812
the synthetics.

830
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,484
How you drove us from our homes
and left us with nothing.

831
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,014
It took us all this
time just to gather

832
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,816
the resources we
needed to come back.

833
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,201
They told us you were monsters.

834
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,121
Savages.

835
01:17:08,349 --> 01:17:10,669
It's kind of just one
side of the story.

836
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,088
I know that now.

837
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,844
So why am I helping you?

838
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,038
'Cause no one said I'd be coming
down here killing kids...

839
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,728
and families.

840
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,024
It's not what I signed up for.

841
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,923
Peter.

842
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,301
Baby! Baby?

843
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:03,720
- Hey, you're doing well.
- I saw...

844
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,181
I saw... I--I saw...

845
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:07,891
I saw... I...

846
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,645
Your dreams... it's the past.

847
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:13,813
It's our past.

848
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,566
- The dreams.
- Yeah.

849
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,276
Those girls... the girls!

850
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,362
No, no, they're waiting for us.

851
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,241
<i>Planet evacuation in progress.</i>

852
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:27,202
<i>Proceed to the platform
in an orderly fashion, please,</i>

853
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,578
<i>and board the train.</i>

854
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,126
We can't wait any longer.

855
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,002
As soon as David gets here,
we're gone.

856
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:36,920
Last train!

857
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,005
Move, move, move!

858
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:41,800
- Lucy, come on.
- Not without Mommy and Daddy!

859
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,511
- Come on.
- They'll be here! Daddy said that!

860
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,899
<i>This is a Level Three
mandatory evacuation.</i>

861
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,569
<i>Follow evacuation protocol.</i>

862
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,947
<i>Proceed to the platform
in an orderly fashion, please,</i>

863
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,115
<i>and board the train.</i>

864
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,595
You guys got to hide.

865
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,798
I'll tell them I'm alone
when they get in here, but...

866
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,858
- I don't know, it's your only shot.
- We gotta get back to the girls.

867
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,645
All right.

868
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,229
Come on. It's okay.

869
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:51,912
All right.

870
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:52,995
You all right?

871
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,293
I'm-- I'm Peter.

872
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,127
Miles.

873
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,382
Here. You know what? Here.

874
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:08,637
It was never mine to begin with,
but thank you.

875
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,464
Are you guys okay?

876
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,382
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

877
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:48,009
Okay, stay tight and low.
Cover, now! Go, go, go!

878
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,219
- Move!
- Go!

879
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:52,848
Go, go, go!

880
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:53,974
Quickly! Go, go!

881
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,108
Cover us! Cover us!

882
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,320
I'll cover you!

883
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,999
Go for the tunnel. I'll cover you.

884
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,462
Go. Go!

885
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:19,768
Come on!

886
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,569
How will they get in?

887
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:42,624
Come on!

888
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,003
Cover me!

889
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,635
Okay, look.

890
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,138
I need you girls
to get onto the transport now.

891
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,391
- We have to wait.
- Please!

892
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,226
They'll be here.

893
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,519
- No!
- Get off me!

894
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,362
- Stop! Please!
- No!

895
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,741
Let me go!

896
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,254
Come on.

897
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,536
Come on, this way.

898
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:56,071
Wait! Wait!

899
01:23:58,324 --> 01:23:59,534
Stop, stop!

900
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:00,617
Hey!

901
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:05,749
- Come on. Come on.
- Wait!

902
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,751
- Wait.
- Wait!

903
01:24:10,164 --> 01:24:11,164
Hanna!

904
01:24:11,906 --> 01:24:13,156
- Lucy!
- Mommy!

905
01:24:13,192 --> 01:24:14,656
- Hey!
- Daddy!

906
01:24:41,785 --> 01:24:43,328
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

907
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,379
I knew you'd save her.

908
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,641
Be right back. Come here.

909
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:53,731
Come here.

910
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,823
You remember?

911
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:05,534
Yeah. Do they?

912
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:10,455
Like you,

913
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,293
they had their memories wiped...

914
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,295
to start clean...

915
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,589
without fear,

916
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,552
free of the guilt of...

917
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,096
what we had to do...

918
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,390
just to be free.

919
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,284
A few of us like me
kept our memories,

920
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,382
so we could prepare
for this day.

921
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:35,899
But now they're all
gonna have to remember,

922
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:38,735
'cause this...

923
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,322
this is not over.

924
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,117
We'll be safe
at our underground base for now.

925
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:49,537
There, we'll finalize our plans
to take back home.

926
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:51,997
So be ready.

927
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:40,838
I thought I lost you.

928
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,427
Sorry that I didn't believe you.

929
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:11,077
Our world...

930
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,121
keeps moving...

931
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,124
changing...

932
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,086
evolving...

933
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,340
and so do we.

934
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:28,678
I know who I am now...

935
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,097
and I know my enemy.

936
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,476
We're not that different.

937
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,020
Maybe...

938
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,399
if others can see that...

939
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,695
we'll have a future after all.
