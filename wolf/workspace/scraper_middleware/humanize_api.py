    a lot of non-answers in here.

the pirate bay used to be great then the owners got jailed and then came the mirror war where tpb mirrors just kept sprouting up.

nowadays it is a low quality public tracker where literal infected releases by "verified" users is not all that rare sadly.

if you just want a "tpb but not tpb" experience, use 1337x.to


I'd add that even 1337 owners have been found guilty of late removal of known infected torrents and some users have suspected them of collaboration with the uploaders.

Should be fine anyway for music and films.

I use

https://katcr.to/
 for movies series etc

https://yts.mx/
 for movies

https://1377x.to/
 movies web

https://nyaa.si/
 for anime

I get almost everything from this sites and never faced any security issues
